ü§î Why I Built This
Most coming soon pages are boring as hell. I wanted something that:

Looks modern but not trendy

Feels alive without being distracting

Works perfectly on phones and desktops

Actually makes people excited for what's coming

The particle system took way longer to get right than I'd like to admit, but the final effect is worth it. The subtle blur overlay keeps text readable while letting the background shine through.

üí° Pro Tips
Change colors by editing the palettes array

Want more/less particles? Adjust particleCount

For launch day, replace the countdown with a "We're Live!" message

MIT License - use it for whatever you want. Just don't claim you made it.
